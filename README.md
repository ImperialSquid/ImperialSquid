# Hi There!
Welcome to my github profile! Here you can read about me, see what cool stuff I've made and fins where to reach me!

# About Me
I'm a very intellectually curious and passionate coder who enjoys finding useful solutions to hard and complex problems. I have a Masters and Bachelors in Data Science and did part of a PhD in Multitasking Neural Networks. I also like doing programming puzzles in my spare time. When I'm not in front of a screen I enjoy reading fantasy books and going for walks.
