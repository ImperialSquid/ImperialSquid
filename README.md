# Hi There!
Welcome to my github profile! Here you can read about me, see what cool stuff I've made and find where to reach me!

# About Me
I'm an intellectually curious and passionate coder who enjoys finding useful solutions to hard and complex problems. I have a BSc and PGDip in Data Science and did part of a PhD in Machine Learning (specifically Multitasking Neural Networks). I also like doing programming puzzles in my spare time. When I'm not in front of a screen I enjoy reading fantasy books and going for walks.
